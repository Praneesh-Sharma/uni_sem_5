/*Guess game
A and B are playing a guessing game where B first thinks up an integer X (positive, negative or
zero, and could be of arbitrarily large magnitude) and A tries to guess it. In response to Aâ€™s guess,
B gives exactly one of the following three replies:
a) Try a bigger number
b) Try a smaller number or
c) You got it.
Write a program by designing an efficient algorithm to minimize the number of guesses A has to
make.*/
